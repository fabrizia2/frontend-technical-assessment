## Implementation Summary

This project implements the required Drag and Drop utility and the dynamic Blog List component, along with a modern, responsive navigation system.

### Completed Features

- **Drag and Drop Utility:** Implemented core drag-and-drop functionality using the native Drag and Drop API. Items can be dragged from a list into various target zones.
- **Blog List Component:**
    - Fetches data from the provided API endpoint.
    - Implements **client-side sorting** (by Date, Reading Time, Category).
    - Implements **client-side filtering** (by Category).
    - Implements **client-side search** (by Title keyword).
    - Displays exactly 10 blogs at a time (initial view).
    - Uses a responsive **3-column grid** layout for blog cards on desktop.
- **Navigation (Task 1, Part 2):**
    - Implemented a **sticky header** that remains at the top during scrolling.
    - Added **smooth scrolling** to target sections (`#drag-section` and `#list-section`).
    - Implemented **dynamic highlighting** for the navigation tab corresponding to the section currently in view (using the Intersection Observer API).
    - Ensured the navigation is **mobile responsive** with a hamburger toggle menu (JS/CSS implementation).
    - Included **accessibility improvements** (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, keyboard focus).
- **Styling:** Applied a consistent, modern, and professional aesthetic across all components as requested in the general overview.

### Technical Challenges

- **Git Workflow Management:** The primary challenge was effectively managing, squashing, and integrating changes from two separate feature branches (`feature/drag-drop` and `feature/navigation`) into `main`, which required multiple interactive rebases and subsequent merge conflict resolution.
- **Dynamic CSS Integration:** Ensuring the dynamically highlighted navigation state (`.active` class) worked reliably across sections of varying lengths and sizes. This was solved using the `IntersectionObserver` with a fine-tuned `rootMargin`.

### AI Usage

- **Gemini (Google):** Used as a co-pilot to generate, refine, and debug the JavaScript logic for the `BlogList` class, structure the CSS for advanced requirements (e.g., sticky header, dynamic highlighting, grid constraints), and guide the Git workflow (squashing and merging).
